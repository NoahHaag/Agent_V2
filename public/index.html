            <h2>Demo: AI-Powered Cover Letter Generation (Concept)</h2>
            <p>Imagine I've just had a great conversation with a recruiter. With my agent, I can quickly generate a personalized follow-up. Here's how it would work in principle:</p>
            <div style="background-color: #e9ecef; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <p><strong>Recruiter Input:</strong> "We're looking for a Machine Learning Engineer with strong Python skills and experience in NLP to join our team working on real-time text analytics."</p>
                <p><strong>My Agent's Action:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Analyzes the job description.</li>
                    <li>Retrieves relevant experience and projects from my resume/CV.</li>
                    <li>Generates a cover letter emphasizing my Python, NLP, and relevant project experience.</li>
                    <li>Presents the letter for quick review and sending.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Example Output (generated by my agent):</strong></p>
                <blockquote style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 10px; border-left: 4px solid #007bff; margin: 10px 0;">
