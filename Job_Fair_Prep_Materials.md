## 🛠️ General Strategy
*   **The "Fieldwork" Hook:** Use your background in Marine Biology/Diving as a differentiator. It proves you are adaptable, safety-conscious, and practical—not just a theoretical coder.
*   **The "Data" Bridge:** Frame your Master's research (meta-analysis) as "Big Data Synthesis." You took messy, unstructured global data and made it usable. That is exactly what tech companies need.
